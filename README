I am a sample OAuth provider built against a vanilla Rails 2.0.x app that does
not use acts_as_authenticated. It merely shows how your application could be
OAuth-enabled and does not validate tokens or do anything particularly fancy
with them.

Note: this is effectively pseudo-code, so don't expect it to work out of the
box.
